## What is Js?

* [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/intro)

It is a programming language.

The standards for it are [the ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and [the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/).

## Why javascript is so famous?

Because it is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but furthermore, it has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.

In other words, JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web.

However, we propose to u first learn some basic concepts of Js before diving into the browser and their js engines.

Let's start though!

## Js characteristics

* high-level programming lenguage
* just-in-time (JIT) compiled
* multi-paradigm
* single-threaded
* dynamic typing

All those topics are covered in different branches. So, feel free to `git checkout "name_of_the_branch"` and lern more and deeper about those topics.
